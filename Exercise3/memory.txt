Most often, we run into memory problems having to do with index out of bound errors.
This occurs because we try to access areas of memory outside those bounded
by our operating system or those bounded by the specific data structure we are using.
This will often create a compilation error and in some cases can even be used
to attack! The buffer overflow attack utilizes unsecure buffer sizes
to overwrite the stack return pointer to execute malicious code.
